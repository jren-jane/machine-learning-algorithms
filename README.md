# Machine learning algorithms
In each folder, I carry out one group of ML models. It generally includes a complete pipeline which consists of data preparation, train-test split, dimensionality reduction, feature standardization, estimation, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using (nested) cross validation. It also has visualization of features, feature correlation, decision boundaries, misclassification matrix and ROC curves.
